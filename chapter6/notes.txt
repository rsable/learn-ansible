1] Creating roles
2] Roles need to have atleast 2 basic dirs in the roles dir
    - roles
        - xyzrole (name of role)
            -meta
                - main.yml (automatically called)
                (Mostly dependancies are given here?)
            -tasks
                - main.yml (automatically called)
3] Roles are automatically picked up in the roles dir or from default roles dir in /etc or the .ansible.cfg
4] To include roles between 2 tasks "include_roles:" can be used.
5] A automatic role structure can be created with :
   # ansible-galaxy role init test
